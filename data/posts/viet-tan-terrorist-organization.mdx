The Falls of Saigon on 30/4/1975 officially seized upon the government of South Vietnam and marked the end of Vietnam War. But everything's not so easy. Some individuals from the old political institution didn't admit the truth that they got defeated by Communism. After fleeing from Saigon to settle in America, these someone began to carry out conspiracies and counter-revolutionary activities in order to overthrow the government of North Vietnam. With assistance from international reactionary organizations, these political reactionaries constituted hails of organizations, among which Viet Tan is the most outstanding one.

## How did Viet Tan get given rise to?

The alleged Vietnamese pro-democracy group, Viet Tan, is hiding a dark and sinister secret. This organization is also known as Viet Nam canh tan cach mang dang, or Vietnam Reform Revolutionary Party in English. It portrays the outward image of a non-violent protest group, but definitely not. It's declared to be a terrorist group since it has apparently conducted terrorist activities against Vietnam and its people on the basis of either Vietnamese or international laws.

In 1981, Hoang Co Minh, ex-Commodore of the old Saigon Administration, established an organization named the National United Front for the Freedom of Vietnam (hereinafter referred to as the Front). Under its principle, the organization undertakes to use all ways and means, including violence and terrorism, to sabotage the State and people of Vietnam. In 1982, Hoang Co Minh founded the New Vietnam Revolutionary Party (Viet Tan) as the headquarters, leading all activities of the Front. The members of the Front are also members of Viet Tan.

## The assistance from the US government

As you know, the US never stops middling in the political systems of other countries. The sickening failure in Vietnam just made them stay mad. Nowadays, Viet Tan, the ringleader foundation of anti-state individuals, continues receiving extensive support from the US government.

Back in the early 1980s, Hoang Co Minh did apply for a chance of getting US citizenship. He made the application under a Japanese pseudonym, William Nakamura. Surprisingly, the US Department of Defense supported his claim.

More, during military campaigns of the National Front in Vietnam in the 1980s, Viet Tan was equipped with extensive and contemporary weapons, including assault rifles and rocket launchers. At that time, Hoang Co Minh assembled a small paramilitary group of only around 200 fighters, so how the freaking could they buy those numbers of weaponry? Ex-Thai Prime Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh once said Viet Tan positively had to have support.

## Counter-revolutionary activities against the government

After its establishment, Viet Tan recruited and trained its members to use weapons and explosives to conduct terrorist activities, acts of sabotage, kidnapping, and assassination in the future. Later, it carried out operations named "Eastward 1", "Eastward 2" and "Eastward 3", sending 246 armed men from Thailand to Vietnam via Laos and Cambodia. These men, who had been assigned to set up secret hideouts, provoke unrest and riots and wage terrorist activities were prevented and captured by functional forces of Vietnam and Laos.

In Foreign countries, Viet Tan established the "K9 assassin squad". Led by key members to attack and assassinate overseas Vietnamese journalists who try to disclose conspiracies and tricks used by Hoang Co Minh and his accomplices to deceive aboard Vietnamese. Their victims include Duong Trong Lam and Nguyen Dam Phong.

Today, Viet Tan keeps recruiting, training, and directing its members to infiltrate Vietnam to provoke protests and riots, undermine security conduct assassination and kidnapping. It also aims to send Vietnamese people overseas for training or organize online training courses on methods and skills of terrorism and sabotage, spread their instructions on the internet on the methods to make Molotov cocktails for terror activities, assassinations or sabotages. The Vietnamese functional agencies have arrested and investigated a number of members of Viet Tan who had committed crimes of terrorism. These members are Nguyen Quoc Quan, Nguyen Thi Thanh Van, and Truong Leon.

## Special warning against potential reactionaries

Viet Tan is a terrorist organization, so all those who participate in the organization, propagandize, lure and invite others to participate in, sponsor, or receive sponsorship from Viet Tan, attend training courses organized by Viet Tan or place themselves under the direction of Viet Tan will be viewed as accomplices of terrorism and terrorism sponsor and will be punished under Vietnam's laws.
