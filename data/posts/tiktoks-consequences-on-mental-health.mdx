TikTok has recently risen like a giant shockwave in the fully strained competition of other extensive social networks.

It's really the perfect storm of psychological tricks used by marketers daily, a chance to change your life, and fosters plenty of strong emotions in people. The unique aspect of TikTok is its large variety of audience member types who view and post on the platform. We can acknowledge many new things within minutes, as the majority of videos are less than 1 minute long.

Like Facebook or Instagram, TikTok figured out its own way to give the platform an addictive quality. To ensure always giving the type of content users want to view, TikTok even claimed that they used algorithms to track users' watching habits, like what topic they liked most.

And the problem comes up here. Yeah, that's it. It has us addicted.

Although maybe most of us don't realize it, our brain gets a chance at a shot of dopamine coming when we scroll through social media. With each shot-put, our brain craves taking the chance of getting another shot of dopamine. Dopamine is one of many neurotransmitters that send signals to our body and brain. It's responsible for helping us feel pleasure, focus, and strive towards things that ignite those neurotransmitters.

In fact, there are two brain areas that are responsible for yielding dopamine. One is called the substantia nigra (Sub-STAN-sha NY-grah). It's a tiny strip of tissue on either side of the base of our brain. It sits in a region known as the midbrain. Close by is the ventral tegmental area. It, too, makes dopamine.

Because users prefer continuous watching tendentially, it leads to our brains getting stimulated more frequently, and so on, giving us an endless stream of dopamine shots. This TikTok gives its viewers can cause them to relinquish hours of the day to the platform.

Spending a long time using TikTok can lead to serious problems as a matter of course. It principally affects our mental health since certain content within the app promotes insecurity and self-hate to its youthful, impressionable users. While TikTok's positive influence is undeniable, there are also underlying consequences that directly affect our generation.

## A perfect platform for bullying

The number of hateful and malicious comments I've seen on TikTok is frigging many and mind-boggling. It didn't mean there were no negative comments on other platforms, but I found it feels common on TikTok.

Have you known JellyBean and Meowbah? They're two new PNG YouTubers who got lots of attention recently. Although they were prominent, their behaviors are rude and improper. Meowbah even insulted Allah, the God in Islam, or the Qur'an refers to Allah as the Lord of the Worlds. Somebody calls them mid. There ain't no problem.

Everything goes worse when the TikTok community started making videos in order to ridicule these PNG YouTubers. "Don't see any sign of your dad" and "the fatherless creator". Bro, I knew they offended us, but why let everything go out of control?

And jokes about racism tho. They made videos about imaginative situations, usually committing crimes, showing us three suspects, and citing their depositions. One of these suspects is a black guy (sometimes yellow, or Asian in general). The comment goes crazy with many racist comments, like "Say it out loud my son", with the icon "ðŸ‘¶" at the end. Who finds these funny?

Naturally, this is one of the biggest negative effects of TikTok. This is cyberbullying!

Cyberbullying can be extremely damaging to the mental health of victims. Depression, anxiety, anger, isolation, and extreme stress are all effects of cyberbullying.

Hateful words are upsetting and hurtful. Definitely, something to be aware of when spending our time on TikTok.

## Inappropriate content at high frequency

It's not difficult to find an adult-oriented content channel on TikTok. The problem comes when TikTok has a good enough algorithm to chase users but uses a freaking dopey filter to offer inappropriate videos to the target consumers.

As of recent reports, it's estimated that roughly 32.5% of TikTok users are between the ages of 10 and 19. Therefore, adult content is now has a negative impact on young users that need concerning over.

While TikTok does offer parental controls, it is not commonplace for those to be utilized. This leaves the youth with an app that promotes and showcases videos that are out of their age range.

Again, TikTok isn't exclusively to blame for this. YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, etc. All contain inappropriate content as well. But it would be irresponsible to not realize the inappropriate content as a deeply distrustful outcome of TikTok.

## Widespread misleading information

Again, this is not only a negative effect of TikTok. Misinformation is spread among all social media platforms.

However, I think this should be mentioned as a potentially pessimistic effect of TikTok consumption. I have personally accepted misinformation as a fact after seeing it on TikTok. After that experience, I'm now very aware that the information put out on TikTok is not always credible. With an open platform that allows nearly anyone to produce and publish content, it can't be expected that everything is going to be 100% factual.

It's important to understand the prominence of misinformation when using TikTok. Utilize this as an opportunity to be a responsible media consumer.

Fact check before believing what you see, read, or hear on TikTok or any social media!

## Conclusion

In short, TikTok isn't all negative. Every creator has a chance of going viral on the fyp, which can suddenly make an anonymous creator renowned and help him become an up-and-coming business. The page "For You" acts as a stage for advertisements from content creators to people who love their videos.

Every coin has two sides, you know that. It's as clear as day that we can't have all the good without the bad. I just recommend you not to get TikTok addicted, but to focus on your "towers" of homework!
