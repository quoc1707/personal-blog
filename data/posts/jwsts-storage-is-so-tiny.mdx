If you're interested in space exploration, you may have seen the first images from NASA's James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). This picture, in fact, is so stunning, and through it, James Webb proved it performed much better in comparison to the old Hubble. With shaper images, scientists can know more secrets about our vast universe, like how it originates and whether we could discover a survivable planet. JWST caught these images at an ultra-high resolution, and the telescope's technologies are sophisticated; it may be shocking to know the fact that it has equipped with a relatively paltry 68GB SSD.

Sound weird, right? Even our laptops have more SSD capacity than this $10-billion telescope, but there's a catch.

## Can it run out of storage?

Staying in constant contact with Earth is impossible, so the information gathered by the JWST has to be preserved somewhere until it can be off-loaded. But, if you're wondering if the drive will run out of space, the answer is, no, it won't.

The 68GB capacity feels pretty dinky when you consider the fact that the first image was an enormous composite of 12.5 hours of exposures; the truth is, the JWST regularly transmits data back to the Earth even before the drive fills. The disk can hold up to 24 hours' worth of information, even when the JWST is churning out its maximum amount of data (about 57GB per day).

In addition to storing observation data, roughly 3% of storage is preserved for engineering and telemetry operations. However, according to expectations from NASA engineers, JWST's onboard capacity can be diminished to around 60GB after a decade in use cause of extremely inclement conditions. With 3% of storage spoken for, could Webb run out of storage sooner than scientists planned? It's hard to say, but NASA engineers seem confident the telescope will reach its 20-year lifespan.

## How does JWST send back data to the Earth?

Although not nearly as quick as ordinary SSDs, the telescope's 48 Mbps control and data management subsystem may never almost fill it in as little as 120 minutes (ICDH).

Presently, the telescope is 932,000 miles from Earth. To send its data all that distance, the JSWT uses 25.9 GHz Ka-band connectivity to the Deep Space Network, which allows for transfer speeds of about 28Mbps/second. In other words, this repeated daily task requires around 24 hours to complete.

## Conclusion

There's no need to preserve the photographs on the telescope itself; it only requires enough space to capture a day's worth of images.
