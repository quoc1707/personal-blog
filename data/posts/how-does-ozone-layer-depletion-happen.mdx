Scientists from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service - a European program that provides continuous data and information on atmospheric composition, ended up 2021 with an announcement worth celebrating: the Antarctic ozone layer hole - that was once larger than this continent has finally closed! This hole is one of the giants and longest-living ozone layer holes since 1979.

Have you ever wondered how those ozone holes have come into being? This article would help you have more insight into this problem; moreover, its implications for our health, and some possible ways to fix it as well.

## How do ozone layer holes come into being?

The phenomenon that causes ozone layer holes is called ozone depletion. Intrinsically, ozone depletion occurs when damaging gases - like chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) and halons gases - are released into the atmosphere.

So how do CFCs destroy the ozone layer?

Firstly, you need to know that CFCs don't react to other substances smoothly. The only condition to make them break up is under sunlight, which causes the release of chlorine to diverge their molecules. Once chlorine is extricated, it'll react with ozone to form chlorine monoxide and oxygen.

Equation: **Cl + O3 → ClO + O2**

When this molecule of ClO combines with another molecule of O, it breaks up, releasing Cl, which can destroy another O3 particle, creating the catalytic cycle of Cl.

Equation: **ClO + O → Cl + O2**

The above reaction provokes destructive effects on ozone particles - the natural protection against UV radiation from Sun.

Fun fact: good news for us is that Cl has natural antagonists (e.g., methane). Thanks to these gases, the ozone layer could retrieve again over 50 years, as long as CFCs are no longer put into use on a global level.

## What are the harmful implications of ozone loss?

The ozone layer acts as a natural, invisible shield and protects us from ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the Sun.

There are two basic kinds of ultraviolet rays reaching the surface: UV-A and UV-B. While UV-A only makes us get sunburnt, its twin brother is much worse.

Unprotected exposure to UV-B rays is responsible for breaking down the DNA structures - the molecule storing the genetic material of all living forms, producing congenital defects or mutations that can lead to skin cancer and premature aging. Worse, these rays can also affect on eyes, including cataracts and eyelid cancer.

Not only humans but plants are also influenced by UV-B radiation. UV-B rays damage cell membranes and organelles within the cells - including chloroplasts, mitochondria, and DNA in the nucleus like what happens to humans. Damage to these organelles affects metabolic processes such as photosynthesis, respiration, growth, and reproduction. As a result, this makes crop yield and quality of agricultural products fall off.

## What purpose were CFCs initially used for?

In the early 20th century, refrigerator manufacturers used toxic chemicals such as ammonia, methyl chloride, and sulfur dioxide as coolants. Several accidents did happen, prompting people to keep the refrigerators far from home and manufacturers to assemble better models of refrigerators.

Chlorofluorocarbon was first discovered in 1928 by Thomas Midgley, Jr. and Charles Franklin Kettering, under the commercial name "Freon".

Freon was once considered a miracle compound as a non-toxic and incombustible alternative to the chemicals in use. Later, CFCs are used to refer to non-toxic, fireproof chemicals containing atoms of carbon, chlorine, and fluorine. They were broadly used in the manufacture of aerosol propellants, blowing agents for foams and packing materials, solvents, and lots of other electric appliances.

They were once viral in the industry until the 1970s when scientists discovered they were linked to a thinning region over Antarctica's ozone layer.

## How do CFCs escape into the atmosphere?

When the coolant used in old refrigerators, air conditioners, and other machines isn't accurately disposed of, it leaks CFCs into the atmosphere as the liquid evaporates.

## The coming forth of a landmark agreement

In 1987, a global protocol was signed to decline the use of ozone-depleting chemicals in general and CFCs in particular - the Montreal Protocol. Most countries have agreed to this, with an estimated number of 200.

The Montreal Protocol is an international treaty designed to protect the ozone layer and help it be on the road to recovery. This agreement saves the stratospheric ozone layer by phasing out the production and consumption of ozone-depleting substances.

Over the past three decades, this convention has done its job very well. As a result of the international agreement, the size of the ozone hole in Antarctica reduced broadly, and it finally closed at the end of 2021.

"If atmospheric chlorine levels from CFCs were as high today as they were in the early 2000s, this year's ozone hole would have been larger by about 1.5 million square miles (about four million square kilometers) under the same weather conditions.", stated NASA.

Notwithstanding, because being inert compounds, CFCs can persist in the stratosphere for 20 to 100 years; therefore, the damage done in the previous century still impacts the environment. According to researchers, to make ozone levels back to the state of 1980, we need to wait for at least the next three decades.

Furthermore, even though most nations have virtually banned CFCs production since 1989 (as the Montreal Protocol entered into force), some specialized products still need these gases contained. Therefore, the industry must follow specific safety measures to responsibly dispose of this dangerous chemical and recycle the material whenever possible.
