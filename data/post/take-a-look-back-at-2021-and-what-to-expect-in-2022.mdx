Maybe you didn't notice that we're all living in the last days of 2021.

We've undergone over two years since the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus (COVID-19) outbreak a pandemic.

In any manner, 2021 has become the worse year in my life so far. Since 2021 is ending, we should sum up how this year has been so far and what we should be optimistic about in the new year 2022.

## Impact on the economy

The global impact of COVID-19 is too much, especially on the economy. Early estimates in 2020 predicated that we would witness a decrease in the overall GDP of the world, and as we expected, this forecast was restated at a GDP loss of 3.4% (global GDP in 2020 amounted to about 84.54 trillion USD, you can figure it out by yourself).

As the impact of COVID-19 on economic conditions in 2021 is more and more destructive, the economic growth rate is estimated to discount as a matter of course.

## Implications for mental health

The COVID-19 pandemic may have brought many transformations to how you live, uncertainty, altered daily routines, financial pressures, and social isolation.

You may get worried about being sick, wonder how long the pandemic will last, whether your job will be affected, or what the future will bring to you. Rumors and terrible misinformation can make your life feel out of control and make you unsure of how to act. During the COVID-19 pandemic, you may encounter stress, fear, sadness, and loneliness. And mental health disorders, for instance, anxiety and depression.

Surveys show a notable rise in the number of US adults reporting symptoms of stress, anxiety, depression, and insomnia during the pandemic, compared with surveys done before. Some people have shot up their use of alcohol or drugs, as these substances were falsely claimed to be effective solutions that can help stressed people cope with their fears. In actuality, using these chemicals can even aggravate anxiety and depression. People with substance use disorders, especially those addicted to tobacco or opioids, are more likely to get poorer outcomes if they get positive for COVID-19. That's because these addictions harm functions of the lung and weaken the immune system, which may lead to cause chronic conditions such as heart disease and lung disease, which increases the risk of severe complications from COVID-19.

## Effects on climate change

During the spring and summer of 2020, ozone concentration at 1 - 8 kilometers above the ground dropped by 7% on average across the Northern Hemisphere. Surface traffic emissions on the global scale went down by 14%, and air-traffic emissions fell by 40% on average in 2020. According to the report published in Geophysical Research Letters, AGU's journal for high-impact, short-format reports with immediate implications spanning all Earth and space sciences, this decline is likely justified by curtailed transportation (due to COVID-19 long-time quarantines). Furthermore, scientists from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) are ending 2021 with an announcement worth celebrating: the ozone layer hole that was once larger than Antarctica has finally closed! This hole is one of the most giant and longest-living ozone layer holes since 1979.

## Staying during self-quarantine

Due to the need for protection against COVID-19, most of us are taking social distance to prevent the spread of this dangerous epidemic. While weeks one through six may have been dedicated to working your way through a giant backlog of Netflix shows and cleaning out every closet and pantry in your house, you may be finding it harder not to succumb to the dreaded stay-at-home blues. Staying entertained during this fucking extended quarantine is a great way to fight this.

However, as the social-distancing quarantine becomes much longer, you may be finding it even more challenging to come up with at-home entertainment ideas while stuck in a never-ending cycle of hearing "I'm bored." So, what's the solution? Some individuals choose to open their wallets in the interest of subscribing to music or video streaming services or purchasing consoles to keep the household busy.

But staying sane doesn't have to break the bank. On top of that, these ways of entertainment can only keep us inquisitive within a short time. I even paid for a Spotify premium account to keep my mind fresh while in the online classroom.

## Expectations for the new year 2022

According to experts, 2022 may be another revolutionary year of technology.

The industry will continue talking about and, in some cases, even building for the metaverse. Some of the core technologies underpinning Web3 may begin to take hold. Metaverse will change the way we've been used to interacting with others. Meanwhile, blockchain-based technologies, especially cryptocurrency, will make monetary systems adapt to changes when crypto is more likely to be accepted as a payment method by plenty of companies.

Ultimately, COVID-19 should be kicked out of the world as soon as better!
