Over time, life beyond Earth has become one of the hottest topics among scientists. Using telescopes and technically modern tools, we have discovered many planets whose structures are nearly similar to our beautiful Earth.

Regrettably, these potentially habitable exoplanets are constantly far from us, reaching hundreds to thousands of light-years. Our civilization doesn't rank even as Type I civilization on the Kardashev scale. Although these power levels are somewhat arbitrary, the Kardashev scale also reflects the relative technological level of society. Then how can we explore these outlying planets?

Instead, searching for life in the solar system seems more achievable. A tour of our solar system reveals a stunning diversity of worlds, from charbroiled Mercury and Venus to the frozen outer reaches of the Oort Cloud. There are a few tantalizing prospects for extraterrestrial life Â¬- subterranean Mars, maybe, or the moons of giant planets (Jupiter, Saturn) with their hidden oceans - but so far, it's just us.

Nevertheless, do not get too disappointed. You did forget Mars - our neighbor planet? From my point of view, this small planet remains the highest possibility of sustaining life. However, why did I say that? Furthermore, how can we turn it back to its original state about millions of years ago?

## Heat up the Martian atmosphere

The atmosphere of Mars is too thin and cold to support liquid water on its surface. With an atmospheric pressure of just 0.6% of Earth, any surface water would be very vulnerable to evaporation or freeze. Almost all water on Mars today exists as ice, even though it also exists as vapor in small quantities in the atmosphere.

There are a few different solutions to how we could heat the atmosphere of Mars and make this planet habitable. Detonating nuclear bombs over Mars' polar caps are also a possible way to terraform Mars, said Elon Musk. Maybe you're worried about radiation and its consequent effects? No, this would not be an issue since the explosion would be in space over the poles, but the heat released would liberate enough water vapor and frozen carbon dioxide - both potent heat-trapping gases - to warm up the planet and melt down the ice.

Nevertheless, this strategy raised a host of scientific and legal questions. From the scientific perspective, the resulting melted ice is estimated to cover the planet to a depth of a few tens of meters under the water, but it probably wouldn't last for long. The carbon dioxide added to Mars' atmosphere by vaporizing the polar caps would double the pressure only. A far cry from the comparable pressure to Earth required warm conditions to sustain surface liquid water and atmospheric water vapor.

On the other side of the globe, the nuke concept could also backfire, ushering in a phenomenon called "nuclear winter" (same as the asteroid's impact that caused the K-Pg extinction of 65 million years ago). This phenomenon happens when a large amount of dust and particles block out a significant portion of the incoming light from the Sun, cooling down the planet. That is not what we want to see.

The sources of CO2 on Mars are abundant, such as those locked in the soil and tightly bonded carbon in minerals, especially rocks. Unfortunately, based on 20-year satellite data from two space agencies - NASA and ESA - if the entire surface of Mars got mined for CO2, the whole atmosphere pressure would only be 10 - 14% of Earth's. This rise in temperature corresponds to the average temperature of about 10 degrees Celcius - not sizzling enough to keep water in liquid form.

Without releasing carbon into the air, we would have other methods to warm up the Red Planet. We can artificially use heat-trapping gases, which are superior to CO2, like CFCs - the cause of ozone layer holes and global warming. Because of being short-lived, the process of adding them needs reprising several times, and on a large scale, to ensure Mars' temperature is always stable. Another idea that is even more insane is redirecting asteroids/comets to hit Mars' surface. What an outlandish idea!

To put this all into perspective: the amount of CO2 needed to heat up Mars must be more than those humans have released throughout world history. And if there is enough CO2, we will need to wait for NASA and other space agencies to do the warming-up in the next 100 years since they initiated.

Miserably, according to scientists working for NASA's Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN mission, our technological level at the current couldn't terraform Mars. So it's clear that we're currently impossible to commit none of the above solutions.

## Create an oxygen-enriched atmosphere

Oxygen plays a critical role in the respiration system, the energy-producing chemistry that drives the metabolisms of most forms of living (apart from some anaerobes, which react negatively or even die if oxygen is present). Oxygen gives creatures' cells the ability to break down food to get the energy to survive. In bodies, hemoglobin is an essential protein found in red blood cells, which transport inspired oxygen from the lungs to the distant tissues, where it got used as fuel for cells to maintain normal metabolism.

Around 2.5 billion years ago, the Earth's atmosphere was full of methane, ammonia, and other gases. Cyanobacteria produced oxygen through photosynthesis, and the atmosphere finally turned into the oxygen-rich as today. Amazingly, oxygen is not necessary during the early stages of the development of life on Earth. But it isn't the main topic here, so I'd better write another article on this interesting question.

Mars does have an atmosphere, but it's about 100 times thinner than Earth's and has very little oxygen. The main component of Mars' atmosphere is carbon dioxide. Hence, astronauts must use spacesuits with oxygen to breathe the Martian air.

Current conditions on Mars are less than 1 kPa of atmospheric pressure and are significantly below the Armstrong limit of 6 kPa. Insufficient pressure causes exposed bodily liquids and the liquids wetting the alveoli within the lungs to boil away. Without a pressure suit, no amount of breathable oxygen delivered by any means will sustain oxygen-breathing life for more than a few minutes. In Rapid (Explosive) Decompression Emergencies in Pressure-Suited Subjects report from NASA, after exposure to the pressure below the Armstrong limit, a survivor reported that his "last conscious memory was of the water on his tongue beginning to boil."

This condition exists since Mars receives less than half the sunlight as Earth - and its planet-level dust storm that even makes visibility worse - researchers have suggested that we could produce micro-organisms on Mars that photosynthesize in low light to create breathable air for humans. When paired with other organisms, we could create an entire life cycle on Mars with a favorable blend of gases.

At International Space Station (ISS), researchers regularly dddddd the ability of these micro-organisms to withstand non-Earth conditions. Surprisingly, some micro-organisms survived in a Mars-simulatory container for 533 days, although they've been more complex life forms.

The only challenge of this solution is time. According to a feasibility study conducted by NASA in 1976, this process would take at least a few THOUSAND years, for even extremophile ones specifically adapted for Mars' environment to make the atmosphere of the Red Planet potentially habitable.

Besides the biological solutions I mentioned, technical solutions are also worth trying. One of the most featured ones is The Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment (MOXIE), introduced by NASA. It's a technology demonstration on the NASA Mars 2020 rover Perseverance investigating oxygen production on Mars. This tool was the first experimental extraction of a natural resource from another planet for human use. If it works effectively, space explorers in the future will be able to use this type of technology - and its successors - to generate oxygen for new-discovered planets.

## Protect the planet against solar radiation

Even if we managed to introduce enough carbon dioxide and oxygen into Mars' atmosphere and sustained liquid water - they would be very vulnerable to being lost in outer space. The Martian atmosphere, as mentioned before, is 100 times thinner than Earth's. Consequently, it prohibits the existence of liquid water at the surface, but many studies suggested that the Martian atmosphere was much stouter in the past.

In common, the gases found on modern Mars are depleted in lighter stable isotopes, showing that the Martian atmosphere has changed by mass-selected processes over its history. Scientists rely on these isotope composition measurements to reconstruct Mars' atmosphere in the past.

Hydro-dynamic escape in the early history of Mars may explain the isotopic fractionation of argon and xenon and contribute to the loss of carbon. Models even suggest that it's possible to lose 1,000 hPa of CO2, caused by hydro-dynamic escape in the range of one to ten million years under strong solar extreme UV on the surface. The out of hydrogen from Mars can be explained by Jeans escape. Other non-thermal processes are necessary to explain the observed escape of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen.

For some reason, Mars has lost up to 99% of its atmosphere. Worse, NASA's MAVEN mission has revealed that Mars is losing its atmosphere, even today. The lack of a protective magnetic field means the solar wind will continue stripping its atmosphere, reverting our efforts to terraform to Mars or constantly degrading them.

Shortly, we would need to fix - or recover the Martian magnetic field. As far from Mars as that would be (about 1.6 million kilometers), we have the technology to give Mars a stronger magnetic shield than what we have on Earth - which is good since Mars lacks enough atmosphere at present to provide any significant protection (though more than was supposed a couple of years ago, as it turns out Mars has a stronger ionosphere). Instead of reviving the magnetic field, we can give it an artificial magnetic shield.

Dr. Jim Green and his colleagues from NASA theorized that a magnetic field placed at the point called L1 between the Sun and Mars, where their gravities roughly cancel out, could theoretically encompass Mars and protect it from the solar wind. After performing extensive calculations that incorporated existing spacecraft data about solar wind behavior and the Martian atmosphere, Dr. Green and his team said a magnetic field of 10,000 - 20,000 Gauss would protect Mars against the solar wind. Sounds fancy but noted that currently, we could only put a smaller shield of 2,000 Gauss at the L1 point. Undertaking such an endeavor is therefore not possible today.

If we did stop the loss of the Martian atmosphere, we could hypothetically pursue several warming methods. Over the next hundreds of years, we could restore as much as 1/7th the amount of liquid water as Mars once had in its oceans and bring back some aspects of that period of habitability.
