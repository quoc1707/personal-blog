There is an ever-increasing of technology in general and electronic devices in particular. Those devices play an important part in each person's life nowadays. But every coin has two sides; hence, technology isn't left out. So, what are the good and bad sides of electronic devices?

## How has technology been revolutionizing our life?

First and foremost, we can't deny the function of electronic devices in making our life easier. It's shown in the daily life of everyone. For example, Apple has integrated AI technologies into its products, such as Siri, voice control, etc. These technologies help people control their devices adequately, find the information on the Internet by voice, and improve their pronunciation as well. With the bits of help from these intelligent devices, we can get access to almost all of the things we're in need of, from shopping to serving the purpose of learning.

Moreover, with electronic devices, lessons can be presented in more ways of presentation, coming with explanations, sounds, and illustrated images. With just a laptop or a computer, you have the means to study everything you desire to acknowledge. One of its versatile abilities is for learning languages. Apps on contemporary devices such as Duolingo, dictionaries, and online newspapers are the top options for you to choose. According to experts in education, sounds, and pictures made a significant contribution to promoting learning. The human brain will work more effectively with sounds and pictures. To be more specific, music is a particular example of sounds, children who listen to music daily start to learn how to pronounce and remember the alphabet. Some people compose their songs with the lyrics from the lessons they had learned at school. In the case of pictures, people tend to remember the logos or the things they have seen for the first time in a colorful way. Those kinds of images and sounds help us remember longer, so if we want to have impressive results in study and work, we should have at least one electronic device.

## What if the use of electronic devices goes out of control?

Besides that, there are still some disadvantages of electronic devices, but I need to force them into main detriments.

Principally, electronic devices undoubtedly make our eyes tired. The eyes are the major part of the body that helps us get access to those electronic devices. So if our eyes become weaker and weaker, do think about it, it's so hard to integrate and use devices. Nowadays, there are a large number of people who have myopia in the world, not only adults but also even children. The myopia phenomenon is the negative consequences of electronic devices.

Additionally, electronic devices make children less communicate. When children turn to less disclosure, they're more likely to stay at home, play games, and watch television. When children tend to be inactive for a long time, they have more chance of catching pathologies, for instance, Autism Spectrum Disorder (abbreviated as ASD). This kind of intellectual disability is proclaimed to be tough to cure and is the repercussion of digital devices.

## Conclusion

In short, electronic devices changed the world by revolutionizing how we learn, work, and live. They're great if we know how to use them in the right ways; in other words, they can counteract if we rely on them too excessively.
