## Where is the final destination of the Russian army?

If you've been watching the news recently, I bet you all knew that Russia only besieges cities without attacking them. Forces infiltrate into places that have been surrounding, involved in exploring the defensive ability. If the opponent seems to have enough powerful mightiness, Russia will evacuate and pin down again. Nowadays, the crucial component of the Russian army is encircling geographically central cities, such as the capital Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Sumy. Russia captured Kherson and is on the way to the Northside, skipping Nikolaev and not heeding Odesa.

Another bizarre phenomenon is plenty of tanks, armored fighting cars, and other vehicles that served military objectives have Russia left behind. The vital cause is due to technically damaged problems inside, while the rest got ruined directly from the side of Ukraine. During the Gulf War, units of military vehicles from the US had also been forsaken when entering Iraq's capital because of damage and running out of fuel. Cause social networks weren't popular at that time, the rest of the world could only see what American media provides; the government strictly controlled these sources as a matter of course. From the beginning of the war to the time of this writing, no battalion conflict happens between Russia and Ukraine. Although the Russian army reported a great deal of damage that they've done, they don't proclaim direct pictures/videos. This is a vital part of Putin's plan to recommend himself to Ukrainian. News from Russia seems trustworthy since they proved their ability to beat up large formations (also of Ukraine) in Donbas in 2015. On the other side of the coin, Ukrainian media continuously declares images related to Russia's damage, but none of them is detected to be more extensive than ambushes to troops.

This raised two questions: where the final goal of Russia is, and where the Ukrainian army locates right now.

First of all, let's take a look at history. The liberation of Ukraine by the Red Army in 1944 lasted about 8 months. During this liberation, the Red Army: about 2.3 million troops, nearly 29,000 artillery and mortars, 2,000 tanks, and 2,370 aircraft encountered 1.8 million German troops, around 17,000 artillery and mortars, 2,200 tanks, and 1,500 aircraft. After 8 months, the Red Army defeated the German army. That shows that the territory of Ukraine is vast sufficiently that becomes a battlefield for two armies with millions of fighting troops. The scale of participation of both sides in the crisis in 2022 is much smaller - only 1/20th of the warring factions in 1944. From the beginning to the present, we can only see large squads of the Russian army, but there was nothing on the Ukrainian side. An intelligible justification is that cause Russia has taken control of the sky, so Ukrainian units can't move without being obliterated. They preferred to entrench themselves in current positions (as about 50% of Ukraine's troops are now in the Donbas) or in densely populated cities as the Russians have so far avoided bombarding densely populated cities to minimize damage to civilians. They didn't even retreat to protect Kharkiv (closer) or the capital Kyiv (further but more vital).

With the number of soldiers equal to 1/20th of the number that Marshal Zhukov used in 1944 to liberate Ukraine, today's Russian generals certainly understand that they can't fight like in 1944. Even with space as vast as Ukraine, they couldn't form continuous front lines. People in small towns in Ukraine see Russian troops arrive and then faded. The explanation for this, I think, is that the Russians are obtaining the cost of stranding their shattered (and later ignited by Ukrainians) cars to seize the leading targets. Those targets are undoubtedly central intersections for encircling and dividing Ukrainian forces. Looking at the red map, it's clear that the Russians have created a small encirclement to surround Ukraine around the Donbas. And it seems that they're tryna construct a much larger one with the junction of the northern forces and the southern wing somewhere south of Kyiv.

There is a detail that gets little credit in the call between Macron and Putin: the French President asked Putin to conserve roads on the south side of Kyiv. Unlike in 1956 and 1968, at this time, the West had a conjecture on where Russia reassembles - maybe somewhere south of Kyiv. If that plan succeeds, the Ukrainian army will be stuck in a "monumental" bag elongating along a north-south axis by the Dnieper River. Then, Russia will tackle each riverside so that Ukrainian troops can't retrieve the rest. That is the reason why the Russian army (with a more undersized force and only 1/20th of the Red Army's in 1944) determined to penetrate deeply to overtake the intersections. With the control of the blue and occupation of the roadway junctions, even though there weren't enough troops to make a continuous frontline coming into being, Russia can still wrap and annihilate large squads from Ukraine. With that such strictly encirclement, Ukraine could escape in small line-ups but without weapons - meaning the eastern regiment would fall apart.

Till the 9th day of the crisis, Kyiv's failure to control and deploy military units was crystal clear. We don't see any photos of tanks, mechanical units, or infantrymen scouting from the Westside to rescue Kyiv or Kharkiv - the second largest city in Ukraine. All we know is the Ukrainians are being offered firearms and guidance to fabricate Molotov by themself.

## Loss of both sides and the media

There is a big difference between the Ukrainian and Russian networks. Ukrainian media maximized images of deceased Russian combatants, wrecked vehicles and humiliated Russian jailbirds of war. While Ukraine's casualties must be greater, Russia didn't profess those images. They're trying to show a friendly relationship between Russian soldiers and inhabitants, efforts to provide humanitarian relief and their weapons' accuracy. With the postwar vision, they want to get the Ukrainians to have faith in and minds. As a consequence, the Russians must pay for that plan in blood. Apart from authentic incursions using rockets, air forces are forced to fly at low altitudes to drop bombs accurately when knocking down targets within residential areas. This clearly showed their drawback: a large portion of bombs they own are still "dumb". Flying at low altitudes to firebomb also costs Russia many downed aircraft.

When entering cities, the Russian units are forbidden to use either artillery fire or tanks to oppress the Ukrainians. This led to them getting ambushed by infantry units in residential areas. Photos of corpses of Russian paratroopers at Gostomel reveal they were killed at a close range. They died right on the vehicles before jumping off. Contrary to what Russia shows in Syria, their units still don't equip contemporary reconnaissance equipment like UAVs.

In recent rounds of talks, the humanitarian corridor has received lots of attention. But why does Russia lay it on Ukraine? Yeah, the purpose of setting up these humanitarian corridors is to let inhabitants run away from conflict zones. Ukraine is accused of using its residents as human shields, and they all know what would happen if denizens are allowed to leave - if Ukraine doesn't surrender, its cities will undergo Grozny's situation in 2000. Therefore, it's expected that Ukraine will prevent residents from evacuating, which became a matter of life or death. The evacuation from Mariupol also failed as there was a gunfight in the safety corridor.

## Reactions from the stakeholders

I don't talk about the embargo cause people already discuss this topic too frequently. I'm here to make a guess about secretly held movements and diplomatic talks among NATO, Ukraine, and Russia. These activities are underway; therefore, we need to make predictions based on declarations from stakeholders and related contexts.

At the beginning of the crisis, all countries belonging to NATO picked the solution they used in the situation of Gruzia in 2008. They object to Russia, but no strong sanctions were imposed. In return, they promised to help ex-leader Saakashvili if the overall situation went worse. Identically, in 2022, they did the same thing to new president Zelensky. Nevertheless, they didn't take what Zenlensky has done into account, and probably Russia didn't expect it either is this frigging dumb leader made a speech on TV, in which he stated the West deserted their country; at the same time, denying the exit solution they prepared for. It was a big shock cause nobody did like him ever before in history - honestly, it's compared to a bolt from the blue. Western countries introduce the strongest sanctions yet unprecedented against Russia to save face. Putin hinted he's ready to use nuclear weapons if the West intervenes. It was a spectacular comeback, despite being unconventional, by Zelensky. I rate him as half as efficacious as the Ukrainian army these days.

However, it's as clear as day that Putin saw the backfire consequence of his menace when traditionally neutralist nations like countries around Scandinavia announced to sponsor weapons for Ukraine, and the Swiss first abandoned its neutralist position to put an embargo on Russia. He made a phone call to French President - Emmanuel Macron and talked to him for nearly one and a half hours. Through Macron, Putin stated he will continue carrying the campaign out - what he's asking for now is the bare minimum. The worst-case didn't mean to occur - intimidated Putin. The Russian delegation is very forbearing and gives the Ukrainians the satisfaction of arranging two rounds of peace talks. Both two times, observations from the side of Russia seems more optimistic. In spite of parleys, Russia's military units are gonna raid and begin capturing paramount towns in case Ukraine leaves them open, for instance, Kherson.

It seems that Putin's intrigues have promoted effectiveness, so when Zelensky declared that Western Europe countries will sponsor old jet fighters from the period of the Soviet Union, both NATO's general secretary and Poland's president contradicted it and proclaimed straight they don't want to oppose Russia. Then, the request by Zelensky about founding a no-fly zone was also got refused. As mentioned above, Russia is now taking control of airspace, resulting in the Ukrainian army can't move even one step. Reject declaration from NATO means Ukraine has to face up to riskier threats. The Prime Minister of Germany pointed out that denying Ukraine a chance to participate in NATO is the cleverest decision they've ever made.

Putin's new declaration is the equivalent of advising Western countries not to embargo Russia. In general, this means in any way, Europe and Russia will have to continue cooperation, and Russia can even take advantage of that proscription to develop itself more progressively; moreover, his nation is still adequately fulfilling its duties. If you watched out for listening to his speech, it's effortless to deduce what he does mean - his attack on Ukraine is gonna do, and the West should think about future commercial business. I was once spent thinking about "fulfilling duties" but didn't realize what it was. It was not a long time before I took a look at the map of gas stream pipelines inside Ukraine territory. Russia still sells gas and other fuel products through these channels. Municipalities surrounded (Kyiv, Kharkiv, Sumy) are all prominent leads of pipelines from Russia. Ukraine itself doesn't dare to destroy them to put pressure on either the West or its "enemy". No matter how desperate they are, the West in general, and Europe in particular, would never let that situation happen.

Perhaps both being denied from the plane to the no-fly zone and still having to keep the gas supply stream to Russia made Zelensky was angry and accused the NATO countries of being cowardly and introvertedly suggesting fear of Russia. A member of Ukraine's delegation of negotiators got caught by the Security Service of Ukraine was initially blamed for being impeached, then later received a death warrant, actually showing the unrest of the Ukrainian government. This scandal reveals Zelensky's anger cause it seems that the West and Russia are negotiating behind Ukraine, which differs from what's happening outside.

## Concern over refugees and not lowering the Ukrainian flag

Opposed to the opinion that Russia didn't plan closely, they really, really did much. Within the first nine days, since the wars began, it's reported that more than 1 million Ukrainian got fleed from danger. Western countries now have to deal with refugees, which number can increase up to several million soon. These asylum seekers would be an oppressive burden on Europe's welfare system as it has been badly affected due to COVID-19 in the last two years. In particular, England declared they could only maximally accept the number of two hundred thousand. Although Europe has announced that one year is the time of welfare for refugees, we all know that they'd have stayed for many years later. In 2021, Belarus - an amenable ally of Russia, facilitated refugees trying to flood into the Old Continent via routes through Poland.

A seeing-worthy point is Russia doesn't expect to lower the Ukrainian flag (apart from the territory of newly isolated countries in Donbas). If Russia honestly wants to split Ukraine, they would host a referendum, like what happened in Crimea; so they didn't let soldiers put the flag down, an action that can be considered a sign of occupation. This clearly shows that Russians have noticed even tiny fragments in the plan. Election days or independence declarations in Ukraine's Eastside have an intimate relationship with refugees. A large portion of asylum seekers used to stay here, and they have reasons to either hate or be afraid of the Russian army. Millions of people leaving for Europe won't vote for any referendum in Western Ukraine. Such a good way to filter who didn't stand with Russia.
