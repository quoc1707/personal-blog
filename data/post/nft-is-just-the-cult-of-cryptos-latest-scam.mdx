"If something looks like a scam, it's probably a scam." - this is the best coolest quote I've ever seen on the Internet. As the crypto world evolves every day, it's easy to see the rise of cryptocurrency spin-off products like Bitcoin, Ethereum, other blockchain-based coins, and NFT. Yes, that's it. NFT is a scam. I don't think it's much of a stretch to say NFT - or non-fungible token - is perhaps the most featured example of the eternal principle in the 21st century.

## Most NFTs are awful and tautologically subjected arts

Let's make a guess why most NFTs, apart from pixeled and ape, are just doodle dashes of color? I argue that because they don't give a fuck about their own selling goods.

And why are they so duplicated? Maybe they're just running out of ideas. The first NFTs are all about apes. People really took care of them, and NFT artists finally saw their chance of business.

However, they weren't tryna to make the best-qualified arts - just hollow inside. Artists don't understand art. They don't understand the culture. They know that these things exist; they know that other people care about them and perform culture because they consider it a commodity.

Since the Ape NFTs became trending, it's all downhill from there. Artists be like: "Look! It seems we can copy that NFT and make changes to create ours!". Look how much money they're making off of this! Look at how much shiftless lion is making off of their litter! Damn, without exaggeration, why waste time and exertion when we oughtn't to be apprehensive about quality?

Another reason for the rising of low-quality NFTs is due to market. The market is so accommodating. It even signaled that quality shouldn't have been a standard to make an appraisal of NFTs.

## NFTs' practical values are impossible to be determined

This minting on the blockchain to legitimize the digital receipts is only creating value for value's sake, not for any artistic benefit or measure of true talent - this is why the discussion of enforcing NFT technology in the workplace is especially concerning. There is no reason for any industry to adopt this needlessly complex and unreservedly malicious technology. To be honest, any corporation breaking into the space of NFTs doesn't have the best interest of anyone at heart - only the concern of profits at the expense of our environment.

Now I'm not so naive as to think that economic universities would educate their students about the dangers of minting frivolous JPEGs on the Ethereum blockchain, but I could have never imagined the heights to which NFTs have risen.

## Marginally relevant information

NFTs, energy-guzzling, and planet-scorching Ethereum transactions also cause environmental impacts. A digital artist discovered that an average NFT has a carbon footprint equivalent to more than a month of electricity usage in Europe. So shocked, right? I thought it must be Bitcoin mining since its energy consumption is high. This high percentage of power consumption is partially due to the many transactions involved with NFTs, including minting, bidding, canceling, sales, and transfer of ownership.

Fun fact: Bitcoin mining produces prodigious amounts of electronic waste (e-waste). It's estimated that Bitcoin accounts for over 24 kilotons of e-waste each year.
