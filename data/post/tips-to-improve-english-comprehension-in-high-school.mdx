Learning English in school may be the worst experience for most students. My friends are typical examples to illustrate students' fear of having to learn English. A guy who's mastered chemistry and another even went through the contest about English. Would you think they're all good at this subject? Definitely not.

The upper example states the realities of Vietnam's current curriculum: most students got taught in a rigid manner. They're forced to reflect many new formulas, leading to forgetting previously acknowledged ones.

If you were feeling too bored at ossified teaching methods, why not be self-reliant? Learning on your own is a far better way to improve your results, and above all else, prepare for more advanced certifications like TOEIC and IELTS, as English is on the way to becoming a universal language worldwide.

## Build the base knowledge

One of the biggest hindrances to reading comprehension is a lack of background knowledge - the amount of information or knowledge someone has on a particular matter. Background knowledge can be most helpful in comprehending non-fiction text, which often proves to be a difficult genre for students to exhaustively understand.

Assume you're currently reading a paragraph with most of the words that seem too advanced, but luckily you got acquainted with it for a long time. Definitions of these new words can be smoothly inferred from the text since you had particular knowledge about it in your mother tongue.

However, solely using background knowledge to support a complete understanding of the presented text, in most cases, is impossible. I suggest you should have a glance at surrounding words since they can give you valuable hints about the meaning, structure of the new word, and how it's used. Associating with background knowledge, you can decipher a word's meaning without further ado.

Words that come before and after the exotic phrasing in the overhead example is called context clues. Context clue plays an important role in helping readers understand what words mean as a single word possesses various definitions.

## Identify and summarize key ideas

You need to recapitulate the text after finalizing reading it in order to pull out the main points and absorb relative facts aside.

This step is critical since you need it later to choose the correct answers (a popular question form in the Vietnamese curriculum). Filter key sentences to start reading and checking with less time spent. In general, you should observe the following steps:

-   **Separate isolated paragraphs from the text**
-   **Look for key ideas amid diffraction and extra information**
-   **Identify central words and phrases**
-   **Ask others if there are unknown vocabularies**

Professionally, you'd better use the method of skimming and scanning. It's not often mentioned in schools as most tests are ephemeral; therefore, you have a long duration to review. However, in IELTS tests, you must finish all 40 questions of the reading part within an hour. Still have no idea about them?

### Skimming

Basically, skimming is leafing through the essay and finding major arguments, not focusing on any specific paragraph. To do this, glance at the title to determine what topic will be discussed, peruse topic sentences and concluding sentences since interpretation and induction are the two most prevalent practices to write a section. Don't forget to watch out for vital nouns or phrases to capture core material.

When to apply this method? When the essay is too lengthy and your time is limited. Skimming helps you find the main thrust and author's opinions in each paragraph, know if he (or she) is enthusiastic, remonstrant, or neutral. Seizing upon them to decide whether stay reading or skip to another part.

### Scanning

Scanning is used to catch critical information to answer the question. Although you've captured the main thrust using skimming, you still have a high chance of being swindled by the author if you don't focus on their use of words, sometimes pun intended.

When to apply this method? When you're in need of looking for information within the essay (proper names, figures, dates, or festive phrases) that doesn't require you to know the key idea.

## Develop vocabulary skills

Vocabulary is an important part of understanding a text and is vital for reading ease and fluency. If you wanna promote the ability to learn and remember new words, try:

-   **Making a word wall in your bedroom (lmao nobody does)**
-   **Pairing new words with physical actions**
-   **Creating graphic organizers that help relate known words to new ones**

Read-aloud strategies can also help you model the process of learning new words for students. Show them how to use context clues to find meaning, and have them make a vocabulary list of all the new words they know or want to learn.

## Implement thinking strategies

To encourage yourself to engage critically with a text, ask questions about on your own:

-   **Where could they spot bias in the material?**
-   **Why did the author choose a particular genre or style?**
-   **What did they think happened before or after the story?**
-   **Why did characters respond to situations the way they did?**

These questions get yourself thinking about the deeper meaning of the text and critically thinking as you need to look for key points. I encourage you to interrogate clarifying questions when you don't know what the text is saying or build mind maps to draw connections between ideas and prior knowledge.

## Create question and answer scenarios

Questioning on different aspects of the text helps you examine it with fresh eyes and find new ways of interpreting it.

Use questions that challenge you to find the answers:

-   **In several different parts of the text**
-   **On your own, using background knowledge**
-   **In your own opinions and responses to the text**

Ask questions to clarify meaning, help you understand characters better, make predictions about the author's intent.

Whether you're answering these questions in a group or individually, they'll get you to have a habit of asking questions and using critical thinking skills. After all, the magic happens when you begin thinking beyond the page!

## Try making inferences

When making inferences, we're using the information we know to make a guess about what we don't.

Instead of just predicting what's going to happen next, you'd better make inferences about information outside the story - what happened before the story started, what genre the story is, or what happens after the story is over.

Like predicting, you can model inferences with read-aloud or guided questioning. Have yourself write a prequel to the story or build a character background based on textual evidence.

Inferences draw conclusions between the text and prior knowledge about how the world works. Plus, it can help boost creativity!
