Recently, the Ministry of Education decided that as the new innovative curriculum for the 2007 generation, history will be migrated into optional subjects, along with geography and some other social ones. This made me shocked the first time hearing it. As you know, history is precisely an addictive issue, even if it's claimed that this discipline is too stodgy for students. Cool it, no matter how sexy history is, it's still a vital element of the curriculum, then who hella suggests it should become self-picked?

## Reasons caused for turning history into optional

In my opinion, the history average mark is too low compared to the rest contributed to the new selection. "The results of the analysis of the scores of the national high school graduation exam on History in 2021 shows that: There are 637,005 candidates taking the History exam, in which the average score is 4.97 points, the median score is 4.75 points. The score with the most candidates achieving is 4.0 points.", according to the newspaper "Lao Động".

These statistics pointed out a critical problem: the currently afloat syllabus is chippy and tedious. Ain't no unexplored, all of us realized for many years, apart from the Ministry. Teachers force students to take notes of and remember a long list of historical events without understanding what happened under the hood.

If you're lucky enough to have passionate teachers taught, they'll definitely give you more aside information; since these efforts are praiseworthy, it's not able to stir up students' love for history. To be honest, instead of making this subject optional, the Ministry of Education should aim to reform the existing curriculum in order to lead to a resurgence of interest in history.

## The consequence of dissolving historic bands

Now, take your backpack and tour Ukraine, the land of clownery people, not only the president but also the habitats.

Getting used to being a country member of the Soviet Union (until this federation disintegrated in 1991), Ukraine should have been following communism. But definitely not. The Orange Revolution in 2004 marked a memorable milestone when Ukraine attempted to complete actions to sever its relationship with Russia to pursue a pro-Western policy. At first, this revolution was expected to help Ukraine re-construct the political system, but it failed in every aspect.

Before the ex-president Viktor Yanukovych was elected in 2010, Ukraine went through a serious socio-economic crisis, which is considered the best worst one in the course of the Ukrainian events with alarming indicators: 2008 - 2009, the total GDP fell by 15%; inflation went up to 16.4%; the percentage of out-of-work people increased as three times as before the slump, from 3% to 9%; and the real income per capita fell by 11%.

The negative impact of the Orange Revolution on the political aspect is much worse than what happened to the economy. Neo-Nazism got up and is on the way to becoming the ideology of the whole country. Like its predecessor, this modern variant is fully hostile, particularly targets the Jews, Poles, and Russians.

Politics has a strong connection with the defense, and Neo-Nazism military units have been founded more and more over time. Among these forces, Azov is perhaps the most featured starring. Despite disproving for pursuing this extreme thought, it's easy to alert to Nazism-related signs appearing on the uniform, as well as bodies, such as angled cross (swastika) or SS (abbreviated Schutzstaffel - a paramilitary group under Nazi Germany's subjection, which is accused of genocide activities in the World War II). Some Azov clansmen claimed they turned to Neo-Nazism inquiry and ultranationalism became ubiquitous between Azov members. Having the Ukraine government itself sponsored after the event of taking back the control of Mariupol from the Eastern separatists, Azov grew, expanded, and finally became an element of the regular army, which was unprecedented.

Worse still, education is also impacted. Children are taught Ukraine was once invaded by the Red Army, and the US and the West offered to help them be independent. Not only children, but also the government put toxic Nazism into adults' heads. They have been pulling down statues of Lenin across the country, one of the central reasons that caused Russia to decide to head a military campaign early in the year.

## Realities of history in Viet Nam

Acknowledging is a thing, while actual grasp and knowing right from wrong is another thing. Of course, the latter is much more difficult.

Now I'm back in Vietnamese schools. History is considered a boring subject, which is both uninteresting and cluttered to students with knowledge. Being forced to learn dense paragraphs and accurately memorizing hundreds of historic milestones is a fear of every student. Besides, most people contended that "History is just an aside subject, it ain't as needed as math, literature, and English", this really caused a sequence of negative results. Cause living in peace, a small portion of youth these days doesn't pay respect to the bones of prior generations. They had sacrificed blood, sweat, and tears for their country; all just for today's generation contradicts and defames the merits of patriotic martyrs. Kids could never know the actual cost of independence, it was not only the bones of warriors but also the tears full of sorrow that fell from Vietnamese heroic mothers' eyes.

The lack of historical understanding has made it easy for propaganda, distorting and opposing statements of Nguy to be made, gradually forming distorted and inimical hypotheses about history, the Communist Party, the regime socialism, and even our great Uncle Ho.
