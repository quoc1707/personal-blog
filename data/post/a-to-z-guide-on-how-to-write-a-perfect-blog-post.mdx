_Sorry you guys, my all beloved audiences! It has been a week since the last time I was active in blogging. The overall situation of the COVID-19 pandemic in my area is now more effervescent, and the school decided to tolerate students returning to the classroom._

_Acquiring new knowledge seems not too challenging, but the classroom is generally awful. Don't get it wrong, bro. It still equips electric appliances like air conditioners and fans, precisely a modern and perfect room for studying. Nevertheless, due to the purpose of preventing coronavirus from being widespread, we can't turn them on, no matter how hot the weather is._

As a citizen of this era, you guys may have been too familiar with different categories of online journals on the Internet, specifically blogs. You're also reading mine right now. So, what's exactly a blog?

## What is a blog?

Blog is a term that describes websites regularly updated, typically operated by individuals. It publishes new articles called blog posts on an ongoing basis. Initially, they were started as a kind of web-based diary.

The most critical characteristic of a typical blog is that content is presented in reversed chronological order, in which posts are sorted in order of time updated.

Nowadays, on every topic imaginable, there must be at least a blog cover on it. However, because of mostly served for personal uses rather than professional, the literacy style of blogs seems more controversial and less formal than other online journals, like news or reports.

## Why write a blog?

Actually, it can be used to serve multiple different purposes than you may think. First of all, it's a great way to express our inside feeling and thoughts or establish ourselves as an authority in our area of expertise. Moreover, blogging helps us enhance writing skills as it's by far the most enigmatic skill to conquer. Likewise, a perfect place to showcase writing, I guess so.

## Different types of blog

Blog posts can be either standalone or parts of a series, and come in different kinds of formats as well (just fucking alike to humans' skin colors and sexual orientations).

-   **how-to**: explain detailed what readers need to do to get their final purposes.{' '} [Wikihow](https://www.wikihow.com/Main-Page), have you ever heard of it?
-   **list-based**: could be a summarily collected list of events, quotes, ways to handle something, frigging intriguing facts,...
-   **review**: usually about blogger's own thoughts about a book, game, movie, gameshow,...{' '} [Moveek](https://moveek.com) is a qualified example of a blog that focuses on film.
-   **personal**: describe what the author has experienced, how they felt, and opinions about it. Mostly found on personal blogs rather than corporate. Sometimes, bloggers can write up these articles to build a more idiosyncratic association with audiences.
-   **explainer**: quite similar to a how-to in that it does provide a throughout explanation of the topic. However, posts that belong to this category aren't presented in a restricted step-by-step format and don't necessarily explain how to complete a task. Considerably lengthy posts are more likely to provide comprehensive overviews and are often labeled "An ultimate guide about..." or something equivalent.
-   **image-based**: could be an infographic or a post consisting of numerous images. You guys do think why not call it an image gallery, right? No matter what an image-based post is, it needs notes under every picture to make it clearer in context.

## How to write a blog post?

In the previous post, we've discovered basic definitions and different types of blogs. So today, we'll move to the next section: setting up and writing the first article for yourself.

Make sure you're free right now cause following these steps already takes lots of time. Are you ready?

### Set up the blog

Nowadays, it's true that there are so many choices of templates available on the Internet. Platforms like Blogger and Google Sites are the top ideal ones to start with. Wanna take a more DIY option? WordPress is for you.

If you're a developer and prefer your own design, you'll need to build from scratch. The easiest way to do this is to pick up an eye-soothing theme and host them as GitHub Pages (powered by Jekyll).

Always determine your budget before starting building a blog. The expenses you need to pay to include: hosting, domain name, design services, and writing, as well as editing.

You can plan to do all of these works by yourself! But always remember that "There's no such thing as a free lunch". Running a blog can be free, but keep in mind that you can't use the registered domain and some web hosting services will intend to exhibit ads popups on websites.

After reaching a considerable number of readers, you can offset costs by selling ads on the website. Don't be greedy to putting too many ads, bro! You all know they're annoying, right? Another strategy to reduce costs is affiliate marketing, which is where you link to an affiliate partner's online product listings in your content; you receive a cut of the revenue they make through your placement of their links.

### Pick up a desirable topic

Given that you got your blog up and running, now it's time to choose the topic for your (first) article.

What does make you passionately write about? If you plan to set up a personal blog like mine, just showcase what you're interested in. Life, science, and even politics (World War III is on the way).

Think about how to attract readers - a gorgeous picture, as an illustration; the title they'd click on, read, and instantly share with others.

Ask your friends what to compose for the next time; you might be surprised by what they suggested! If your buddies can't come up with even one opinion, let's take a glance at other blogs. That doesn't mean you should completely steal the original ideas or plagiarize their works; consider it as a source of inspiration, then cover it again, but from a different perspective and in your own unique voice.

### Write an outline

Following the writing process enables you to craft a thoughtful and well-developed piece. This is a fundamental principle in any writing project. And blog posts are no exception, too.

After you've determined the topic to write in Step 2, create an outline. List your working title and the key points you wanna hit in the post. Don't forget to make these points into separated sections with their own header.

A blog post would follow a similar structure to an essay. It starts with an introduction, explanations in the body, then finally, the conclusion.

Once your outline is complete, it's time to start writing! I prefer Google Docs over Microsoft Word as it's more convenient, and I never get disturbed by the error popup.

### Hook your readers

In any kind of writing, the hook is one of the most significant parts. This sentence or paragraph is the part that grabs the reader's attention and promises that their curiosity will be satisfied if they keep reading.

In reality, there are plenty of ways to hook your readers' attention, but the ideal method for each blog depends on the audience and the subject the post is covering. Presenting a startling fact in the short description seems the most prevalent type of hook.

### Give readers a solid call to action

A call to action is a short phrase that asks the reader to do something. This might be to leave a comment, make a purchase, subscribe to your newsletter, or read a related post next. Calls to action generally make use of direct-response copywriting principles, like making specific requests and creating a sense of urgency.

### Edit and proofread again

Although you might have been very careful while composing, it's incapable of avoiding errors, even smallish ones. Read through the post one more time, and take note of any spot where your writing sounds awkward, choppy, or excessively wordy. You can consult editing sources like writing guide books, experience from fellow writers or grammar checkers like Grammarly (this ain't no fucking sponsored advertisement).

### Enhance with relevant images

Tell me what you feel when reading a book nearly full of walls of text. So bored, right? How about a picture one? Much better since the illustrations inside bring the story to life.

The same thing happens when you include images in blog posts. They break up the text and give your readers short intermissions as they work through your content.

If you frequently read how-to blogs, you'd see the sporadic use of images in their posts. They help readers visualize the points the blogger is making. Moreover, pictures help them avoid mistakes by exemplifying what the project should look like as they follow it step by step.

### Reach a wider audience

To achieve this, you need to use SEO strategies. SEO, which stands for Search Engine Optimization is a term used to refer to tactics website owners use to increase their sites' visibility. The better the SEO strategy is, the more chance of being shown up in search results the website has. The goal is to have your blog be the first listing appearing when people google specific keywords.

Here are some other ways to improve SEO:

-   **Organize content neatly**: you should limit the frequency of walls of text, which are continuously written paragraphs without gaps, or it's best to avoid them all the way.
-   **Embed relevant images with appropriate keywords**: information about them called metadata, which gives the bot crawlers more context to pictures themself, such as file names and alternative descriptions.
-   **Keep the post to an SEO-friendly length**: posts clock in at 1,000 words or even longer usually rank well. But don't take this as a requirement! Even if your article is far briefer, it's no problem - you just need to utilize other SEO tactics.
-   **Provide only valuable information**: after all, the most vital mission of a blog is to furnish helpful information. It can be a fugitive post, but still better than such a waste of time.

When setting up the blog, remember to integrate analytics services to see how well your blog performs. With collected statistics, you can know precisely how many people have visited, how long they have stayed on, which post was in the top search, etc; which are indicators of your content being effective.
